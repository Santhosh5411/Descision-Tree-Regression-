Mobicom urgently need a meeting with the marketing head and retention manager. 
The agenda of this meeting is to discuss the results of Industry survey reports that have been just released. 
In response to these reports, senior management at Mobicom is concerned that the market environment of rising churn 
rates and declining ARPU will hit them even harder as churn rate at Mobicom is relatively high. Currently they have 
been focussing on retaining their customers on a reactive basis when the subscriber calls in to close the account. 
But this alone does not seem to be enough and the management team is keen to take more initiatives on this front. 
One of these is to roll out targeted proactive retention programs, which include usage enhancing marketing programs 
to increase minutes of usage (MOU), rate plan migration, and a bundling strategy among others.  To be able to effectively drive 
these retention strategies, a few key questions of interest require urgent attention and you been given the task of showcasing 
data based insights and recommendations relating to subscriber churn.
